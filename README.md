SUMMARY
====================
A minimal set of tools to manage a plain-text Zettelkasten [^1] from the command line.


SETUP
====================
Dependencies:
- Python 3.8+
- nvim
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (only needed for search features)

Configuration:
- add _zettelkasten/bin_ to your path


EXAMPLES
====================

### New Zettelkasten files (`zn`)

    zn / foo               # creates `1-foo.md`
    zn / bar               # creates `2-bar.md`
    zn 1 another thought   # creates `1a-another-thought.md`

### List Zettelkasten (`zl`)

    zl

Produces:

    07-20 1     foo
           1a   another thought

     Â     2     bar

### Move Zettelkasten files (`zm`)

Moving means both renaming the file and all references to it.

Insert reference:

    echo "a link to file 2-bar.md" >> 1a-another-thought.md

Move the file:

    zm 2-bar.md 1a1-bar.md

New hierarchy:

    07-20 1       foo
           1a     another thought
            1a1   bar

Updated reference:

    a link to file 1a1-bar.md


STRUCTURE
====================

### Filename

Filenames have the following structure:

    12a1-TAG1-TAG2-a-short-description-of-topic-A.md
    ^    ^
    UID  TAGS      ^ DESCRIPTION

Tags are prefaced, all-caps.

### UID

Per usual practice the UID consists of alternating numbers and characters.

### Lists

Given the following files:

    # Created on 07-20:
    zn / foo
    zn / bar

    # Created on 07-21:
    zn 1 another thought
    zn / SHAPES 2d
    zn 3-SHAPES-2d.md triangle
    zn 3a equilateral
    zn 3a scalene
    zn 3 quadrilateral

The list (`zl`) will be shown as:

    07-20 1             foo
    07-21  1a           another thought

    07-20 2             bar

    07-21 3      SHAPES 2d
           3a           triangle
            3a1         equilateral
            3a2         scalene
           3b           quadrilateral

The list can be ordered by last updated time with `ctrl-l`:

    07-20 1             foo
          2             bar

    07-21  1a           another thought
          3      SHAPES 2d
           3a           triangle
            3a1         equilateral
            3a2         scalene
           3b           quadrilateral

Switch back to order-by-name with `ctrl-n`.
